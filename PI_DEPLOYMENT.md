# Raspberry Pi Deployment Guide

## Overview

This document describes how to deploy TrailCurrent to a Raspberry Pi using the offline deployment package. The system uses pre-built Docker images bundled into a zip file — no internet access is required on the Pi after initial OS setup.

For initial device setup (OS, Docker, CAN bus), see [DOCS/PiSetup.md](DOCS/PiSetup.md).

---

## Deployment Package

The deployment zip is created on your development machine using:

```bash
./create-deployment-package.sh --version=1.0.0
```

This produces `trailcurrent-deployment-1.0.0.zip` containing:
- `images/*.tar` — 7 pre-built ARM64 Docker images (including MongoDB)
- `docker-compose.yml` — Service orchestration
- `config/` — Mosquitto and Node-RED configuration
- `local_code/` — Python CAN-to-MQTT bridge and OTA helpers
- `firmware/wired/` — MCU firmware binaries (if available)
- `scripts/` — SSL certificate generation
- `.env.example` — Environment variable template
- `deploy.sh` — Deployment orchestrator
- `PI_DEPLOYMENT.md` — This file

---

## First-Time Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi with Docker installed (see [DOCS/PiSetup.md](DOCS/PiSetup.md))
- SSH access to the Pi
- `jq` installed (`sudo apt install jq`) — needed for OTA firmware deployment
- Map tiles file (`map.mbtiles`) transferred separately (~25GB)

### Steps

1. **Transfer the deployment package to the Pi:**
   ```bash
   scp trailcurrent-deployment-1.0.0.zip trailcurrent@trailcurrent01.local:~
   ```

2. **SSH to the Pi and extract:**
   ```bash
   ssh trailcurrent@trailcurrent01.local
   unzip trailcurrent-deployment-1.0.0.zip
   ```

3. **Run the deployment script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

   On first run, `deploy.sh` will:
   - Create `.env` from `.env.example` and ask you to edit it (then re-run)
   - Generate TLS certificates automatically using `scripts/generate-certs.sh`
   - Load all Docker images from tar files
   - Start all services
   - Set up the CAN-to-MQTT bridge
   - Set up the deployment watcher (for cloud OTA updates)
   - Deploy MCU firmware via OTA (if firmware is included)

4. **Edit `.env` with your credentials** (first run only):
   ```bash
   nano .env
   # Set these values:
   #   MQTT_USERNAME / MQTT_PASSWORD
   #   ADMIN_PASSWORD
   #   TLS_CERT_HOSTNAME=trailcurrent01.local
   #   ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
   #   NODE_RED_CREDENTIAL_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64)
   ```
   Then re-run `./deploy.sh`.

5. **Place the map tiles file** (first time or when updating maps):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data/tileserver
   # Transfer map.mbtiles to data/tileserver/
   ```

6. **Install the CA certificate on phones/tablets** (for PWA home screen icon):

   TrailCurrent uses a self-signed TLS certificate. Browsers will let you
   tap through the certificate warning, but iOS requires the CA to be
   trusted at the OS level for the PWA "Add to Home Screen" icon to work.
   Without this step the home screen icon will show a generic letter
   instead of the TrailCurrent logo.

   **Copy the CA certificate from the Pi:**
   ```bash
   scp trailcurrent@trailcurrent01.local:~/data/keys/ca.crt ~/Desktop/TrailCurrent-CA.crt
   ```

   **iOS (iPhone / iPad):**
   1. Transfer `TrailCurrent-CA.crt` to the device (AirDrop, email, or iCloud Drive)
   2. Open the file — iOS will show "Profile Downloaded"
   3. Go to **Settings > General > VPN & Device Management** and install the profile
   4. Go to **Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings** and enable full trust for **TrailCurrent-CA**
   5. Now open Safari, navigate to the app, and use **Share > Add to Home Screen**

   **Android:**
   1. Transfer `TrailCurrent-CA.crt` to the device
   2. Open the file — Android will prompt to install it as a CA certificate
   3. Follow the on-screen prompts (you may need to set a screen lock if you haven't already)

   **macOS:**
   1. Double-click `TrailCurrent-CA.crt` to add it to Keychain Access
   2. Find **TrailCurrent-CA** in the System keychain, double-click it
   3. Expand **Trust** and set to **Always Trust**

   **Windows:**
   1. Double-click `TrailCurrent-CA.crt` > **Install Certificate**
   2. Choose **Local Machine** > **Place in: Trusted Root Certification Authorities**

   This only needs to be done once per device. The CA certificate is valid
   for 10 years and will trust any server certificates generated by your Pi.

7. **Access the application:**
   ```
   https://trailcurrent01.local
   ```

## Subsequent Updates

When deploying a new version:

1. **Transfer new zip to Pi:**
   ```bash
   scp trailcurrent-deployment-1.1.0.zip trailcurrent@trailcurrent01.local:~
   ```

2. **SSH in, extract, and deploy:**
   ```bash
   ssh trailcurrent@trailcurrent01.local
   unzip -o trailcurrent-deployment-1.1.0.zip
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

   On updates, `deploy.sh` will:
   - Stop existing services
   - Load updated Docker images
   - Preserve your `.env`, certificates, map tiles, and Node-RED flows
   - Restart all services
   - Restart the deployment watcher service
   - Update MCU firmware if new firmware is included

---

## What Persists Across Updates

These items are **PRESERVED** and never deleted by `deploy.sh`:

### Application Configuration
- `.env` — Device-specific secrets and settings
  - MQTT credentials, admin password, encryption keys, hostname

### Security
- `data/keys/` — TLS certificates
  - CA certificate: 10-year validity — no need to regenerate or re-install on devices
  - Server certificate: ~2-year validity (825 days, required by Apple/iOS)
  - To renew the server cert: `./scripts/generate-certs.sh 2` (uses existing CA, no need to re-install CA on devices)

### Data
- `data/tileserver/map.mbtiles` — Map tile database (~25GB)
- `data/node-red/` — User-created Node-RED flows and credentials
- MongoDB data volume — All application state

**CRITICAL: Never delete `data/` directory during updates!**

---

## What Changes During Updates

- Docker container images (loaded from new tar files)
- Application code (backend, frontend, etc.)
- Container configurations (`config/`)
- Python local code (`local_code/`)
- MCU firmware (if included in package)

---

## Verification After Deployment

```bash
# All containers running
docker compose ps

# No errors in logs
docker compose logs --tail=20

# CAN-to-MQTT bridge running
sudo systemctl status cantomqtt.service

# Deployment watcher running (for cloud OTA updates)
sudo systemctl status deployment-watcher.service

# API responding
curl -k https://localhost/api/health

# Web UI accessible
curl -k -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}" https://localhost/
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Containers fail to start
```bash
# Check logs for specific service
docker compose logs <service-name>
# Services: backend, frontend, mosquitto, mongodb, node-red, noderedproxy, tileserver

# Restart all containers
docker compose down && docker compose up -d --no-build
```

### CAN-to-MQTT bridge not working
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status cantomqtt.service
sudo journalctl -u cantomqtt.service -f

# Verify CAN bus interface
ip link show can0

# Check local_code .env has correct external hostname
grep MQTT_BROKER_URL ~/local_code/.env
```

### Deployment watcher not picking up cloud updates
```bash
# Check service status and logs
sudo systemctl status deployment-watcher.service
sudo journalctl -u deployment-watcher.service -f

# Verify cloud is configured via the PWA (Settings > Cloud Configuration)
# The watcher logs will show "Cloud not enabled" or "config incomplete" if not set up
```

### Out of disk space
```bash
df -h
docker system prune -f  # Removes unused images, preserves data/
```

### Network issues
```bash
nslookup trailcurrent01.local
ping trailcurrent01.local
```
